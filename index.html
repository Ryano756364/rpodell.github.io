          <p>Built with Java language, DAO methodology,  and MySQL relational database instruction, 
            this program allows an employee to take a client's application, store the data, and return what 
            they qualify for on a new home purchase. Inspiration for the project is based on my experience as a 
            mortgage loan officer. </p>
        <div class="title-heading">Daily Call Log Project</div>
          <p>Small program from scratch using the Vue.js CLI framework to format the build. The goal of the program is to
